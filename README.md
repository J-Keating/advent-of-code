* [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) - Done to learn [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (incomplete)
* [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) - Done to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Completed!  Learned a lot and managed to complete all the puzzles, but not until mid-January.  Didn't *quite* make the leaderboard.  :)
